I develop and maintain:

* A solver dedicated to geometrical packing problems [fontanf/packingsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/packingsolver)

* Packages that simplify the implementation of combinatorial optimization algorithms based on the following methods:
  * Local search [fontanf/localsearchsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/localsearchsolver) (C++) [fontanf/localsearchsolverpy](https://github.com/fontanf/localsearchsolverpy) (Python3)
  * Heuristic tree search [fontanf/treesearchsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/treesearchsolver) (C++) [fontanf/treesearchsolverpy](https://github.com/fontanf/treesearchsolverpy) (Python3)
  * Column generation heuristics [fontanf/columngenerationsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/columngenerationsolver) (C++) [fontanf/columngenerationsolverpy](https://github.com/fontanf/columngenerationsolverpy) (Python3)

* Solvers for various fundamental operations research problems:
  * 0-1 knapsack problem, subset-sum problem, multiple-choice subset-sum problem [fontanf/knapsacksolver](https://github.com/fontanf/knapsacksolver)
  * Generalized assignment problem [fontanf/generalizedassignmentsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/generalizedassignmentsolver)
  * (Unicost) set covering problem [fontanf/setcoveringsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/setcoveringsolver)
  * Maximum(-weight) independent set and maximum-(weight) clique problems [fontanf/stablesolver](https://github.com/fontanf/stablesolver)
  * Graph coloring problem  [fontanf/coloringsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/coloringsolver)
  * Traveling salesman problem  [fontanf/travelingsalesmansolver](https://github.com/fontanf/travelingsalesmansolver)

* A repository containing data, instance parsers and solution checkers for various operations research problems  [fontanf/orproblems](https://github.com/fontanf/orproblems). These problems are used in the examples of the packages mentioned above.

* A repository containing various tools used by my other repositories  [fontanf/optimizationtools](https://github.com/fontanf/optimizationtools)

Finally, the repository [fontanf/teaching](https://github.com/fontanf/teaching) contains the material I use to teach.

*Do not hesitate to let me know if you use some of my codes. I'm happy to know that they are useful. And I'll be more careful not to break everything in the next update. And do not hesitate to give me some feedback as well.*

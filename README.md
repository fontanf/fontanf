I develop and maintain:

* Packages that simplify the implementation of combinatorial optimization algorithms based on the following methods:
  * Local Search [fontanf/localsearchsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/localsearchsolver)
  * Heuristic Tree Search [fontanf/treesearchsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/treesearchsolver) (C++) [fontanf/treesearchsolverpy](https://github.com/fontanf/treesearchsolverpy) (Python3)
  * Column Generation Heuristics [fontanf/columngenerationsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/columngenerationsolver)

* Solvers for various fundamental Operations Research problems:
  * 0-1 Knapsack Problem [fontanf/knapsacksolver](https://github.com/fontanf/knapsacksolver)
  * Generalized Assignment Problem [fontanf/generalizedassignmentsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/generalizedassignmentsolver)
  * (Unicost) Set Covering Problem [fontanf/setcoveringsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/setcoveringsolver)
  * Maximum(-Weight) Independent Set and Maximum-(Weight) Clique Problems [fontanf/stablesolver](https://github.com/fontanf/stablesolver)
  * Graph Coloring Problem  [fontanf/coloringsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/coloringsolver)

* A solver dedicated to geometrical Packing Problems based on Tree Search and Column Generation  [fontanf/packingsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/packingsolver)

* A repository containing data, instance parsers and solution checkers for various Operations Research problems  [fontanf/orproblems](https://github.com/fontanf/orproblems). These problems are used in the examples of the packages mentioned above.

* A repository containing various tools used by my other repositories  [fontanf/optimizationtools](https://github.com/fontanf/optimizationtools)

Finally, the repository [fontanf/teaching](https://github.com/fontanf/teaching) contains the material I use to teach.

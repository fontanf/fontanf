* Packages that simplify the implementation of combinatorial optimization algorithms based on the following methods:
  * Local search [fontanf/localsearchsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/localsearchsolver) (C++) [fontanf/localsearchsolverpy](https://github.com/fontanf/localsearchsolverpy) (Python3)
  * Heuristic tree search [fontanf/treesearchsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/treesearchsolver) (C++) [fontanf/treesearchsolverpy](https://github.com/fontanf/treesearchsolverpy) (Python3)

* Other libraries to simplify the implementation of optimizaztion algorithms:
  * Various data structures [fontanf/optimizationtools](https://github.com/fontanf/optimizationtools)
  * Simplify solvers integration with CMake + a simple MILP modeler [fontanf/mathoptsolverscmake](https://github.com/fontanf/mathoptsolverscmake)
  * A C++ interface for the nonlinear solver Artelys Knitro [fontanf/knitrocpp](https://github.com/fontanf/knitrocpp)
  * A geometry library that supports line segments and circular arcs [fontanf/shape](https://github.com/fontanf/shape)

* Solvers for various fundamental optimization problems that often appear as subproblems of more complex optimization problems:
  * 0-1 knapsack problem [fontanf/knapsacksolver](https://github.com/fontanf/knapsacksolver)
  * Subset-sum problem [fontanf/subsetsumsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/subsetsumsolver)
  * Multiple-choice subset-sum problem [fontanf/multiplechoicesubsetsumsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/multiplechoicesubsetsumsolver)
  * Generalized assignment problem [fontanf/generalizedassignmentsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/generalizedassignmentsolver)
  * (Unicost) set covering problem [fontanf/setcoveringsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/setcoveringsolver)
  * Maximum(-weight) independent set and maximum-(weight) clique problems [fontanf/stablesolver](https://github.com/fontanf/stablesolver)
  * Graph coloring problem  [fontanf/coloringsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/coloringsolver)
  * Traveling salesman problem  [fontanf/travelingsalesmansolver](https://github.com/fontanf/travelingsalesmansolver)

* Some research codes:
  * Star observation scheduling problems [fontanf/starobservationschedulingsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/starobservationschedulingsolver)
  * Travelling thief problems [fontanf/travellingthiefsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/travellingthiefsolver)
  * Flow shop, job shop and open shop scheduling problems [fontanf/shopschedulingsolver](https://github.com/fontanf/shopschedulingsolver)
  * Knapsack problem with conflicts [fontanf/knapsackwithconflictssolver](https://github.com/fontanf/knapsackwithconflictssolver)

Finally, the repository [fontanf/teaching](https://github.com/fontanf/teaching) contains the material I use to teach.

*Do not hesitate to let me know if you use some of my codes. I'm happy to know that they are useful. And I'll be more careful not to break everything in the next update. And do not hesitate to give me some feedback as well.*
